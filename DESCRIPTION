Title: A tool for fitting linear models to data structures generated by phylogenetic birth-death processes.
Version: 0.1.0
Authors: Jan Smyčka, Grace I. Ridder
Maintainer: Jan Smyčka <smyckaj@gmail.com>
Description: This package fits likelihood-based linear models to the response data drawn from phylogenetic birth-death process
    This allows to evaluate quality of predictors of the birth death diversification process, including a generalized R square value. Currently implemented data type is number of species n after time t, with a possibility of conditioning on survival. In future, we expect to add similar procedures also for whole phylogenetic trees.
