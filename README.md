# BirDLinG

This package fits likelihood-based linear models to the response data drawn from phylogenetic birth-death process. This allows to evaluate quality of predictors of the birth death diversification process, including a generalized R square value. Currently implemented data type is number of species *n* after time *t*, with a possibility of conditioning on survival. In future, we expect to add similar procedures also for whole phylogenetic trees. 

The package can be installed via 
```R
devtools::install_github("smyckaj/BirDLinG")
```
